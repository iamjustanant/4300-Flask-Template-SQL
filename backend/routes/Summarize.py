# TODO: Using all available resources at your disposal,
# implement a route that takes in a search term 
# and returns a summary of the consensus. Lowkey kinda up to you!

# For instance, you could give you an agreement score for both the UN nations and X users,
# so that users can see how much agreement there is on a given topic.

# Or you could give the summary in English format "It looks like most people agree with you on this topic."

# Or something, idk.

# Just let Dan know what the response will be so that he can handle it on the frontend.

# Of course, the first parameter provided is the SQL Engine itself, which lets you execute SQL queries on the database.

def summarize_handler(sql_engine,text):
    return "Hello, world!"
